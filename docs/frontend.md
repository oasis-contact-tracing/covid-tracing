## Maps Prototype

Uses Google Map's API to load markers onto a simple map instance. 

## Setup

1. Install the vue cli tool (it's what allows us to run the dev server) with `npm install -g @vue/cli`

2. Inside the maps project, run `npm install` and `npm install node-sass`. This will install all the dependencies associated with the project (listed in package-lock.json)

3. Add the file `apiKey.js` to the `/src/constants` directory. 

4. Run `npm run serve` to start the app!
