![Yale COVID-19 Contact Tracing System](NewLogo.png)

The purpose of this project is to develop a database for storing contact tracing information, as well as information that can be used for predictive modeling, and accompanying infrastructure for visualization of the data. In addition, we aim to improve the data-input experience for contact tracing volunteers. Read more about each segment of the project below.

### **A Centralized Spatial Database**
The goal of the centralized spacial database is to both provide a simple visualization tool for doctors, researchers, and the general public and to improve the ease of database entry. Additional factors considered include time and location, in addition to contacts. An informational risk-analysis system for the general public is built into the map visualization (to see what places are hot-spots). All data in the database is voluntarily provided and anonymous.

### **Long Term, University-Specific COVID-19 Tracking**
Once the University begins to reopen, we hope to provide a proactive tracing system. This will help the population feel more comfortable opening and pull together contact tracing data to better track the virus if it appears on campus. This project could also aid in random testing on campus by making random selections more informed.
